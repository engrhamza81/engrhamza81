//     Inheritance Error:
//     In a scenario where Class B inherits from Class A, what error might occur if Class A's constructor is not accessible in Class B?

//     Namespace Error:
//     When using namespaces in C++, what error might occur if you forget to include the namespace declaration in a particular file?

//     Polymorphism Error:
//     If you have a base class with a virtual function and a derived class that overrides it, what error could occur if you forget to mark the overridden function with the override keyword?

//     Class Error:
//     In a class definition, what error could arise if you forget to terminate the class declaration with a semicolon?

//     Static Member Error:
//     What error might occur if you try to access a static member of a class using an object rather than the class itself?

//     Exception Handling Error:
//     In exception handling, what error might occur if you forget to catch an exception that is thrown within a try block?

//     Inheritance & Polymorphism Error:
//     If you have a base class with a pure virtual function and a derived class that fails to implement it, what error would you encounter?

//     Namespace & Class Error:
//     What error might occur if you define a class within a namespace but forget to include the namespace when accessing the class?

//     Polymorphism & Exception Handling Error:
//     In a polymorphic hierarchy, what error might occur if the base class destructor is not declared as virtual and objects are destroyed through base class pointers?

//     Static Member & Exception Handling Error:
//     How would you handle exceptions thrown within a static member function, considering static member functions do not have access to instance-specific data?

// These questions should help in exploring potential errors and misconceptions related to the specified concepts.
